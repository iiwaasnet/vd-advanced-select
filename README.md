AngularJS Advanced-select
===============================

Advanced-Select is a set of AngularJS directives to make more powerfull select boxes (Like Select2)

You can see working examples at [http://vincentdieltiens.github.com/vd-advanced-select](http://vincentdieltiens.github.com/vd-advanced-select)

Why Advanced-select ?
---------------------

Because I was using [Select2](http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2) with jQuery and I wanted the same with AngularJS. [Angular-ui](http://angular-ui.github.io) have made a Select2 directive that uses the [Select2](http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2) plugin but ngOptions are not compatibles (I tried to adapt it but without success). 

Also, I think that's better to write a directive that uses the power of AngularJS bindings.

Brower Compatibility
--------------------

I'm mostly using Chrome and Firefox (the latest versions). I've tried on :

- Google Chrome >= 26.0.1410 (Mac OS X)
- Mozilla Firefox >= 21.0 (Max OS X)
- Opera >= 12.15 (Mac OS X)
- Safari >= 5.1.7 (Mac OS X)

Note : As Advanced select is a `<a>` (or `input`), you have to activate the keyboard navigation on Mac OS X (see http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200906/enabling_keyboard_navigation_in_mac_os_x_web_browsers/) to naviguate using the `tab` key.
